# Systematic Best Practices for Java's New Features: Java has abandoned OOP in favor of my theory!

Copyright Â© 2024.04.15 Lin Pengcheng. All rights reserved. 

Starting with Java 8, Java started to change its slow 
and clunky image, trying to add new features and 
improve performance. However, since Java's main 
application area is enterprise applications, 
the strategy of updating the programming language 
is more conservative, and most of them are still 
sticking to Java 8, and not many enterprises 
or individuals are applying the new features of Java. 
There are only brief introductions to the stand-alone 
use of individual new features, not articles on 
best practice guidelines for the systematic use of 
multiple new features, and people don't realize that 
Java has abandoned OOP in favor of my theory, 
[**"The Math-based Grand Unified Programming Theory: The Pure Function Pipeline Data Flow with Principle-based Warehouse/Workshop Model"**](https://github.com/linpengcheng/PurefunctionPipelineDataflow)!

- Workshop: Stream (JDK 8-9), Stream Gatherers (JDK 22)

  Stream is an object-style pipeline operation used to
  construct a pipeline of production data 
  within the workshop.

- Warehouse: Records (JDK 14 to 16)

  Record is an immutable datatype that is used as a data carrier, 
  primarily in scenarios where data is stored,
  preserved, and there is no additional custom behavior. 
  It is very suitable for use as a "repository", of course, 
  if there are special needs, other Java classes are more
  suitable, it can also be applied, my theory has a strong
  compatibility. See also: [**"The unification with FP and OOP"**](https://github.com/linpengcheng/PurefunctionPipelineDataflow#The-unification-with-object-oriented)
  
    - Class: In my theory classes are mainly used as 
      namespaces to organize code, or compatible with 
      OOP to use traditional Java code.

    - Object: Objects are not needed in my theory, 
      which is used for compatibility with OOP 
      in order to use traditional Java code.
    
- Scheduler: Virtual Threads (JDK 19-21), Structured Concurrency (JDK 19-22)

  - Structured Concurrency
  
    Used to construct the scheduler algorithm: 
    Dynamic Tree Gantt Chart (Operations Research).

  - Virtual Threads
    
    Used to run tasks after assigning them to workshops.

  - JEP 467: Markdown Document Annotation

    This feature uses my original method from 2019-02-17,
    [**"Markdown Literary Programming that don't break the syntax of any programming language"**](https://github.com/linpengcheng/PurefunctionPipelineDataflow/blob/master/doc/markdown_literary_programming.md).
    My approach is simpler, flexible, visual, extensible, 
    and applicable to all programming languages and 
    markup languages.It takes source code from the text age to the web age, 
    and improves the functionality and experience dramatically.

  - Native Compilation (GraalVM), Native Code Interaction

    Similar to what I said in 
    [**"The unification with Programming Language Platform"**](https://github.com/linpengcheng/PurefunctionPipelineDataflow#The-unification-with-Programming-Language-Platform), 
    except that I advocate using Lisp to represent 
    the intermediate language, which is simpler, clearer, 
    more convenient, and easier to implement and extend;
    GraalVM uses JVM bytecode as intermediate language.

  - Syntax enhancements, tool enhancements
  
    These have nothing to do with programming paradigms 
    and will not be discussed.    
    
In summary, the new features of Java indicate that Java 
has abandoned OOP in favor of my theory, 
[**"The Math-based Grand Unified Programming Theory: The Pure Function Pipeline Data Flow with Principle-based Warehouse/Workshop Model"**](https://github.com/linpengcheng/PurefunctionPipelineDataflow)! 
Combined with Java's strong development of native 
compilation and native code interaction, it shows that 
Java's two core concepts of OOP and virtual machines 
have been abandoned.

Why did Java abandon OOP in favor of my theory? 
The reason is as follows:

- Java's main application area is enterprise application
  software, from the reference model, my Warehouse/Workshop
  Model is a natural and direct counterpart to the
  architecture of enterprise application software, 
  which is simple, clear, and much superior to the 
  current mainstream OOP, FP, and command programming.

- In my article [**"Traditional IT theory (OO, FP and hardware architecture, etc.) VS. Warehouse/Workshop Model"**](https://github.com/linpengcheng/PurefunctionPipelineDataflow#Traditional-OO-and-FP-architecture-VS-Warehouse-Workshop-Model), 
  I pointed out that my Warehouse/Workshop Model is based on
  mathematical models, which is a downgrade from the
  pseudo-science of OOP, FP, and imperative programming.

- My Warehouse/Workshop Model is data-centered, which is
  consistent with database thinking, so database vendors 
  are natural allies of my theory, and Oracle, the owner 
  of Java, is the largest database vendor, so it's a 
  natural choice for Java to turn to my theory.

- In my Chinese article [**"My theory has an estimated 100,000 high level followers around the world (Attachment: Most authoritative peer review)"**](https://github.com/linpengcheng/PurefunctionPipelineDataflow/blob/master/doc/estimated_100k_high_level_followers.md), 
  I pointed out that my Warehouse/Workshop Model has 
  already achieved absolute victory at the lowest level 
  of CPU/SoC chips and computer hardware architectures, 
  and that in the IT field, the lowest level of technology
  determines the upper level of technology, and thus my 
  theory has achieved absolute victory at all levels of 
  the IT field, such as OS, DB, programming languages, 
  and application development. It's just a matter of time,
  this is the inevitable law, the Java language change 
  is just a beginning.

Whether Java had the idea written in this article before or not, 
from now on, Java must have the idea and work hard to develop for it! :-)
