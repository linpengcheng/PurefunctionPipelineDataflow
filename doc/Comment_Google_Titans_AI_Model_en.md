It combines my Warehouse/Workshop model with the Transformer architecture 
to simulate the workings of the brain, but it is only a simple superficial simulation 
of the workings of the brain, the architecture lacks abstraction, 
and there is no mathematical global optimization mechanism, 
so it is still very complex and inefficient. 

This is the most common mistake of Western thinking, which is too concrete, 
too much superficial empirical evidence of objective matter.

It is not enough to simulate the workings of the brain, 
it is necessary to know how to efficiently dispatch all the resources 
to accomplish the task, this is scientific management!
