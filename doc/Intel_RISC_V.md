Prediction: Intel will use RISC-V plus x86 compatibility layer to develop a new generation of "warehouse/workshop model" CPU. 
It will not only reverse the competitive situation with Apple M1, but also open up the market for IoT CPUs.

If developing the x86 compatibility layer is too troublesome, there is a quick solution, 
because my "warehouse/workshop model" naturally supports heterogeneous computing and can 
provide 1 or 2 x86 cores in the CPU to execute x86 instructions specifically to provide compatibility.

Intel has been in a lot of trouble recently. There is an Apple M1 chip using my warehouse/workshop model on the front, 
which not only greatly beats Intel’s CPU in performance, but also maintains a greater energy-saving advantage. 
In addition, as I said in the blog post, M1 also There is a lot of space for optimization. 
The new M2 is said to be coming out soon, and AMD is catching up. Intel is in a hurry to change its CEO.

Intel’s original technology accumulation and development route can be said to be useless. 
If it is useful, it has been put into the market long ago, and now it can only be completely updated..

Now the only architecture that fully surpasses the "von Neumann architecture" is my "warehouse/workshop model". 
I think Intel has no choice but to "warehouse/workshop model".

If ARM and RISC-V manufacturers join the "warehouse/workshop model" CPU competition, it will pose a serious threat to Intel. 
I have not seen any news in this regard, but at least one or two major manufacturers should join the competition,
The market has entered a stage of fierce competition. In addition, Microsoft's support is very important, 
especially Microsoft and Qualcomm have a close cooperative relationship to jointly develop the "Windows/ARM PC".

The huge x86 stock market will still give Intel a period of funding and buffer space, 
and the future Internet of Things market will be even broader. 
About news of "Intel Offers $2 Billion for RISC-V Chip Startup SiFive",
RISC-V is open source and can be extended proprietary. 
It is the best choice for Intel with excellent CPU design talents, 
and it is also the best choice for Intel to strive for market leadership. 

Danger and opportunity coexist. This is the moment that determines the life and death of Intel, 
just like the phoenix nirvana, or rebirth from ashes, or burned to death.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger's recent announcement that the company would begin licensing its own x86 processor designs 
to other firms as part of its new IDM 2.0 initiative was surprising. 
In view of Intel's previous licensing policy, I think this is Intel's preparation to abandon x86.
Intel’s x86 processor design license is likely to target Chinese companies.
I think x86 is an outdated design that is about to be phased out.
Chinese companies should not bid too high.

  I think Intel should use my solution, 
  Because if Intel wants to implement this solution it has to use my "Warehouse/Workshop Model",
  Because Intel's 10nm process is not as precise as the Apple M1's 5nm process, 
  So it can't integrate as much memory as the Apple M1, ie: can't use the standard warehouse/workshop model, 
  can only use variant "dispatch center (virtual global unified warehouse, 
  integration layer or platform, the parent company of the enterprise group)" model, 
  and improve the shortcomings of not integrating large memory by increasing the cache, 
  This seems to implement a large repository as a two-level repository: 
  a small integrated warehouse (cache) and a large external warehouse (memory).
  
- 2023.10.25 Qualcomm releases Snapdragon X Elite against Apple's M-series SoCs

- 2024.06, Intel releases warehouse/workshop model SoC: Lunar Lake

  2024.06, Intel releases warehouse/workshop model SoC: Lunar Lake, and by now,
  the two major CPUs (ARM and x86) had joined my theoretical camp,
  declaring that CPUs/SoCs had fully entered the era of warehouse/workshop model
  created by me to unify the hardware world.

  Three years ago, I predicted that Intel would inevitably release a warehouse/workshop model SoC,
  x86 CPUs are poorly implemented, too complex and bloated, high power consumption, high heat,
  it's best to use RISC-V plus x86 compatibility layer (or x86 CPUs), and enter the PC
  and the Internet of Things at the same time as the technological innovation, a three-in-one,
  Intel is also ready to spend $2 billion to acquire the high-performance RISC-V Intel was
  also ready to spend $2 billion to acquire SiFive, a leading high-performance RISC-V vendor,
  but unfortunately SiFive didn't want to sell. It would have been too time-consuming for
  Intel to design RISC-V from scratch on its own, and it would have lost the business opportunity,
  so it had to build SoC by adapting x86 CPUs.

  Warehouse/workshop model SoCs require sophisticated manufacturing processes,
  Intel desperately paid a high price to get priority manufacturing rights for
  TSMC's 3nm process with Apple, but unfortunately, x86 CPUs are poorly implemented,
  too complex and bloated, and consume a lot of power. 
  
  Its warehouse/workshop model SoC Lunar Lake, built using the 3nm process,
  is surprisingly inferior to the 5nm Apple M1 released about four years ago (2020-11-11),
  and high-power consumption, heat, large size, can only launch the desktop PC version,
  can not release the low-power version of the laptop computer needs. To solve Intel's current problems,
  in fact, is also very simple, there are many options to choose from, I have solved the major directional,
  systemic, architectural, and principle issues, I will not talk about these small issues,
  counting as homework! :-)

  At present, Apple (ARM), Qualcomm (ARM), Intel (x86) three major CPU vendors have released
  warehouse/workshop model SoC, the fourth major vendor AMD has no choice, do not follow
  only a dead end. In fact, AMD also released the SoC Ryzen AI 300 without memory in June 2024,
  it should not have grabbed the 3nm precision process priority manufacturing rights and R&D progress,
  and will definitely follow with the warehouse/workshop model SoCs. So CPU/SoCs have fully entered
  the era of the warehouse/workshop model created by me, and unified the field of hardware.

  The major PC parts manufacturers as if only nvidia I have not criticized,
  I have read a H100 architecture article, would like to criticize,
  because too busy to delay until the H200 came out and did not write,
  outdated old products do not want to write, although the H100 is still banned
  from exporting Chinese products. I write articles have always been more casual,
  no special to find H200 architecture information, because now the IT industry
  hardware and software architecture are not supported by mathematical models,
  not scientific, to find the problem is too easy!

  In the IT field, the underlying hardware technology determines the upper layer
  software technology, and the software field will inevitably enter the era of
  the warehouse/workshop model created by me to unify the entire IT field.

  I claim that my mathematical model based warehouse/workshop model theory
  as the core of the unification of a number of industry theory system,
  why do I only grasp the IT industry to fight? The reason is very simple,
  in the street hooligans fight, are nailed to the leader,
  the most active one to fight, to beat him convinced,
  the others will also be convinced.

  This reasoning also applies to the field of science, the IT industry is known
  as high-tech hot industry, and applied to all industries, popularity, popularity,
  application of the highest degree, the most respected mathematical bias and
  the core of the underlying hardware and software system construction methodology
  is not supported by mathematical models, and this is the biggest advantage of my theory.

  The strongest advantages of my theory to attack the strongest industry's greatest weaknesses,
  hold up the banner of mathematics, the lowering of the dimensional strike,
  the attack has the greatest effect, the highest efficiency, the fastest speed, the strongest shock.

  After the strongest industry was defeated, other industries naturally obeyed,
  and the first theoretical empire in the academic world was established,
  and I became the first emperor of the academic world!

  ```
  All truth passes through three stages:
  1. it is ridiculed.
  2. it is violently opposed.
  3. it is accepted as being self-evident.
      ---- Schopenhauer
  ```
      
  Apparently, my theory has reached stage 3.

  I have found my numerous fulfilled prophecies or assertions
  that I have posted publicly in these last few years
  to be 100% correct!

Attachment: Comment: AMD Infinity Fabric Architecture

x86+RISC-V heterogeneous computing architecture 
is my innovation, published on Chinese Weibo on June 14, 2021,
I published it on the github blog on June 15, 2021, 
and found this article a few days later,
Written by `Joel Hruska` on June 15, 2021
[《AMD Is Working on Its Own Hybrid x86 CPU: Patent Filing》](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/323713-amd-is-working-on-its-own-hybrid-x86-cpu-patent-filing)
The earliest comment of this article is 2021-06-16, 
this article is modified based on the previous old article,
The previous old article is just similar to ARM's `big.Little` core,
The content of the patent is ["METHOD OF TASK TRANSITION BETWEEN HETEROGENOUS PROCESSORS"](https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2021/0173715.html).
it is a task transition between the big core 
and the little core. The article only adds a short 
paragraph of `Hybrid x86 CPU` expression 
at the beginning and end, 
which is very abrupt and inconsistent.

This article mentions AMD’s ["METHOD OF TASK TRANSITION BETWEEN HETEROGENOUS PROCESSORS"](https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2021/0173715.html)
Patent, its content is the task transition between 
the big core and the little core,
According to my 10 principles of "Warehouse/Workshop Model", 
AMD’s patented technology is unnecessary.
Violated the principles: Division of tasks, 
Order, and Definiteness.

From the schematic diagram of the article, 
AMD is centered on the Infinity Fabric bus.
Realize the task transition between CPU-CPU, 
and plan to realize the task transition 
between GPU-GPU and CPU-GPU in the future.
That is, the interconnection between workshops. 
In the manufacturing industry, I have not seen 
this kind of architecture for arbitrary 
interconnection of workshops.
This is a network structure, very chaotic 
and complicated, with poor scalability, 
poor flexibility, and poor data utilization efficiency.
I think it’s relatively easy to transfer tasks between 
similar processors, Task transfer between different 
types of processors is complicated and difficult, 
and the effect is not very good.
I think it is far inferior to my `warehouse/workshop model` 
which is simple, reliable, flexible and extensible.
With warehouse (data) as the center, 
data access efficiency is high, 
which is roughly similar to the 
[Comparison of Microsoft Data Factory/Pipeline Architecture and Warehouse/Workshop Model](https://github.com/linpengcheng/PurefunctionPipelineDataflow/blob/master/doc/diff_WWModel_AzureDataFactoryPipe.md)
In fact, although Apple M1 has not yet fully realized 
the `warehouse/workshop model`, the Apple M1 is already No. 1.

Attachment: RISC-V VS. ARM (by 2021.12.06)

I think the expandable architecture of RISC-V is excellent. 
It is equivalent to an expandable version of ARM (e.g. Apple M1 chip).
As long as the extended standardization work is done well, 
the prospects are quite good.

I think other ARM manufacturers also want to replicate the success of Apple M1 chip, 
but I have not heard that they have any standard work, 
which will lead to fragmentation of ARM-based SOC systems. 
In the end, it will lose to RISC-V, which worked hard to standardize the extension.

Postscript:

From the 2022-11-01 Chinese News, ["After 2024, ARM chips can only use the public version? Qualcomm is disabled self-developed GPU"](https://www.51cto.com/article/721715.html):

> ARM does not intend to allow external GPUs, NPUs or ISPs to exist in SoCs based on ARM architecture, 
> including Qualcomm's Adreno, the GPU used by Samsung in partnership with AMD, 
> and everyone needs to change back to the "public version" of ARM.

ARM adopted my view a year ago (2021-12-06), but this will be very dissatisfied with the various princes who use ARM, ARM's approach is right, we should standardize its SoC architecture while the monopoly position is still there, otherwise if the SoC based on ARM is fragmented, it will fail.
