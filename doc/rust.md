Rust implements safe and efficient programming by simulating bank lending practices. 
This is the first time in the programming language world to reference financial models at the language level, 
but unfortunately, Rust language designers are not proficient in financial knowledge 
and have made mistakes in core fundamental issues. 
The relationship between borrowing and lending is not a buying and selling relationship. 
It is caused by the transfer of resource use rights, not the transfer of ownership. 
It causes a series of semantic errors and cannot fully and correctly refer to the financial system knowledge, 
making its programming too complicated.

The financial system is the safest, most stable, most rigorous, largest 
and most tried-and-tested system in human history. 
From ancient times to today, male, female, old, young, wise, stupid, positive, evil, good, evil, 
With the participation of the whole people in the game, 
Rust only learned a little bit of fur and took the wrong knowledge, 
but he also achieved great success. 

Therefore, I suggest that computer science should classify financial knowledge as a compulsory course, 
which has great reference significance for building a safe, efficient and stable system.

Besides, financial modeling is too complicated, 
using my “Warehouse/Workshop Model” is much simpler, 
reliable, stable, efficient, high performance.
It's fast, rough and furious, full of manufactured industrial style.

In July 2020, Tsinghua University, China's number one, opened a "double degree in computer and finance"

我很欣喜地看到新的以安全高效著称的系统编程语言Rust出现，并且反响很好，很成功，它通过模拟银行的借贷行为来实现安全高效地编程，
这是编程语言界第一次在语言级借鉴财务金融领域的模型。

但很不幸的是Rust语言设计人员不精通财务金融知识，在核心基础问题搞错了，借贷关系不是买卖关系，引发的是资源使用权的转移，
而不是所有权的转移，引起一系列语义错误，不能完整正确地参照财务金融系统知识，使其编程过于复杂。

Rust设计人员还是很厉害的，象欧阳锋一样，拿着一本错乱的财务九阴真经，依靠宗师级的计算机功底居然给圆过来，并修炼成功，
虽然有点怪异疯颠[偷笑]。

财务金融系统是人类历史上最安全，最稳定，最严密，最大规模，最久经考验的系统，古今男女老少贤愚正邪善恶黑白全员参与博弈，
Rust只学了一点皮毛并带错误的知识，居然也能获得巨大成功。

所以，我建议计算机专业把财务金融知识列为必修课，这对构建安全、高效、稳定的系统有极大的参考意义。

另外, 金融模型太复杂了, 用我的"仓库/车间模型"会更简单,可靠,稳定,高效,高性能, 主打一个快糙猛, 满满的制造工业风格.
