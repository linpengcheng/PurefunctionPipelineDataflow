# Comment: 2024-10-16 “AMD Intel rare alliance, unprecedented invitation to Google, Microsoft, Meta sit, Kissinger called surreal: x86 is not dead! Netizen: the opponent is not even Nvidia

I think AMD and Intel alliance, if as this article said, 
only to the existing x86 to make compatibility, meaningless, 
because the existing x86 instruction set is already compatible, 
the other a little incompatible parts (AVX, AMX) is not commonly used, 
improve them meaningless, and does not improve their competitiveness with ARM!

As I advised ARM on 2021.12.06, adopted by ARM on 2022.11.01, 
I think AMD and Intel should look to the future and do a better job of compatibility with 
the new generation of SoCs/CPUs that apply my warehouse/workshop model.

Also, I think Intel's new generation of SoCs/CPUs 
that apply my warehouse/workshop model are poorly implemented, 
there are many good ways to do this, 
so don't keep thinking about copying homework from me, haha!
